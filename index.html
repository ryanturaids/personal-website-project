                            I used to sell closets, now I'm looking forward to building applications and websites. I've spent most my life in California
                            along with a brief stint in Texas, and while I am a homebody I occasionally have the urge to travel and explore.

                            I love solving problems, and I love making those solutions <i>solve their own problems</i>. Throughout my career I've spent countless
                            hours automating nearly every single aspect of my job that I could, and when those automated solutions became complex I found myself 
                            a fixture in our IT department, bugging them with constant questions. I've built more databases and bulky Excel functions than I can
                            count, but struggled to teach myself beyond the basics. Now, realizing that I found more joy in the process of building and optimizing
                            systems than I did using them, I've decided to jump in with both feet.
